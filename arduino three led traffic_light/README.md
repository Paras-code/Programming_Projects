This sketch implements a traffic light using the [Arduino TaskScheduler Library](). It goes from red to green and back. Green light blinks before going back to yellow.

## The challenge 

Modify code to add a turn signal (a white LED connected to pin 13).

The turn signal up 3 seconds after green, stays on for 3 seconds, then blinks for 5 seconds together with green (in sync with green), before switching back to yellow.
